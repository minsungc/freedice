# freedice

freedice is an implementation of the discrete PPL Dice in free(er) monadic form. 
it uses extensible interpreter technology (tm) to give you two "backends" for dice: the boring standard inference and the interesting WBF compilation.
on top of that it allows for easily composable semantic extensions, such as adding choice or autodiff, without much hassle, i hope.

but mainly it is an excuse for me to toy around with haskell without steven thinking i'm not doing research.
